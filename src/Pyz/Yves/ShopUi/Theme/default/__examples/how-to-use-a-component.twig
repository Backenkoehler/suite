HOW TO USE A COMPONENT
#}

{#
include

you can use a component by including it into another twig file
in order to easily accedd a component, you can rely on helpers functions:
- atom(name, module)
- molecule(name, module)
- organism(name, module)

all these functions work the same way:
name (mandatory): arg for the component name
module (optional): arg for the spryker module (if null, then ShopUi is used by default)

@return
this function `molecule('new-component-counter')` returns a string in the format:
@ShopUi/components/molecules/new-component-counter/new-component-counter.twig

this function `organism('some-name', 'CartPage')` returns a string in the format:
@CartPage/components/organisms/some-name/some-name.twig

--
the include is called with 2 arguments:
- with {}: it defines the context to pass to the component twig file
- only: VERY IMPORTANT - it closes the context to ONLY the object passed using `with {}`

data object must be respect the contract defined into the object
attributes object is optional, but it has to respect the mandatory attributes, whether defined
#}
{% include molecule('new-component-counter') with {
    data: {
        name: 'Looking for a tags',
        description: 'How many links are in this page?'
    },
    attributes: {
        'element-selector': 'a'
    }
} only %}

{#
embed

you can use a component by embedding it
this allows you to extend or change the blocks defined into the component
whether needed

in the first case, we're extending the body block by appending some message after it
th the second case, we're overwriting the counter block by removing some unneeded text
#}
{% embed molecule('new-component-counter') with {
    data: {
        name: 'Looking for a tags',
        description: 'How many links are in this page?'
    },
    attributes: {
        'element-selector': 'a'
    },
    embed: {
        message: 'Woohoo!'
    }
} only %}
    {% block body %}
        {{parent()}}
        {{embed.message}}
    {% endblock %}

    {% block counter %}
        <strong class="{{config.name}}__counter {{config.jsName}}__counter"></strong>
    {% endblock %}
{% endembed %}
