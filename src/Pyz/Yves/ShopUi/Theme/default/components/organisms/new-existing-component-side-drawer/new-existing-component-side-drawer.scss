// this is how you can extend a style
// by passing a name to the specific mixing, you're rendering block, elements and modifiers
// with the new block classname
// then you can extend the style as follows:

@include shop-ui-side-drawer('.new-existing-component-side-drawer') {
    color: $setting-color-alt;

    &__overlay {
        background-color: $setting-color-main;
    }
}

// evert mixin included in SprykerShop ShopUi module is shared, therefore globally accessible
// from every scss
